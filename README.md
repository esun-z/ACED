## Running

Clone this project and change the forms in the beginning of ACED.cpp to apply your own settings. Then generate the executable file with Visual Studio 2015 or other available version which may cause some problems.

Put ACED.exe beside a folder called scrcpy, in which there is a release of [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/releases/.)

Make sure you have linked your android phone to your computer either by USB or by wireless android debug bridge.

Then run ACED.exe and enjoy.

## Notice

**This is a project working in progress, it is not stable and may cause some errors.**

**I am not going to maintain this project, so fork or clone it and make it better by yourself if you want.**

**I didn't release any release because you still need to change the forms in the beginning of ACED.cpp to apply your own settings.**
